# **PROJECT GALLERY**

Web page created for [_Founders and Coders_](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/portfolio/project-gallery/project/) as part of exercises requested to access to the Bootcamp, eventually.  
The project says:
_"Build a gallery which displays the projects you’ve been working on. You might include this in your application website to showcase what you’ve learnt and created while completing our requirements."_
